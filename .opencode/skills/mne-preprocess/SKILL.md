# MNE Preprocessing (grill → analyze → critic)

Preprocessing & data-quality cleanup of neurophysiology data via the MNE MCP server. This skill is
**skeptical by design**: nearly every preprocessing mistake (a too-aggressive high-pass that eats
your slow ERP, a reference that biases connectivity, filtering after epoching, differential
bad-channel handling between groups) runs *without any error* and silently biases everything
downstream — so the discipline is to **grill the downstream analysis before cleaning, and critique
the pipeline before believing.**

> Companion skills: `mne-mcp-guard` for technical execution safety; `mne-methodology-critic` for
> Phase 3. Loaded objects persist in one MNE session, and preprocessing edits are **in place**.

## PHASE 1 — GRILL (before processing anything)

Do **not** filter, reference, or resample until these are answered. If the user can't answer one,
propose a sensible default **and explicitly flag the open risk** — never silently choose.

**The question that decides every parameter**
- **What is the DOWNSTREAM analysis?** Filter choices follow from it, and there is no neutral
  default: **0.1 Hz** high-pass for **ERP** (slow components survive), **~1 Hz** high-pass for **ICA**
  (drift hurts decomposition), **broadband / no/low high-pass** for **TFR / low-frequency power**.
  Set the pipeline to the analysis, not the other way round.

**Filtering**
- High-pass edge — and ⚠️ **will the filter edge distort the effect of interest?** A 0.5–1 Hz HP can
  attenuate/shift slow ERP components (CNV, P300, readiness potential). Justify the edge.
- Low-pass edge (anti-alias / smoothing) and **transition bandwidth**; FIR (linear-phase, default)
  vs IIR (causal, ringing tradeoffs)?
- **Line frequency: 50 or 60 Hz?** (region-dependent) — notch it (+ harmonics) or rely on a low-pass
  below it?

**Resampling**
- Needed at all? If so, **before or after epoching?** Downsample **after** epoching where possible —
  resampling continuous data jitters event sample positions. New sfreq must stay **> 2× the low-pass**
  (anti-aliasing) — MNE low-passes on resample, but verify.

**Reference & montage**
- Montage system (`standard_1020`, `biosemi64`, `GSN-HydroCel-128`, …)? Needed for interpolation,
  topomaps, and source work.
- Reference rationale: average / REST / linked-mastoid / bipolar — and **does it suit the later
  analysis?** Average/common references inflate apparent **connectivity** and matter for **source**
  modeling; pin the reference to those needs now, not after.

**Bad channels & quality**
- Bad-channel criteria: **objective** (variance/flatness/correlation thresholds, e.g. PyPREP/RANSAC)
  or **eyeballed**? Will the **two groups be treated differently** (differential handling fabricates
  group effects)?
- Will interpolation be used, and how many channels — interpolation **reduces data rank**, which
  caps later ICA / source `n_components`.
- Segments to crop or annotate-and-reject (and the same objective vs eyeballed concern)?

## PHASE 2 — ANALYZE

1. **Capability + look first.** `mne_check_status`; then **look before cleaning**: `mne_plot_psd`
   (read the PNG — find the **line-noise** spike at 50/60 Hz + harmonics, drift, dead/noisy channels)
   and `mne_plot_raw` (drifts, flat lines, jumps). `mne_plot_sensors` to confirm the montage.

2. **Montage** (if positions aren't already set) — needed for interpolation/topomaps:
   `mne_set_montage(name="raw", montage="standard_1020")`.

3. **Filter + notch**, with the edge chosen for the *downstream* analysis:

   ```python
   # ERP pipeline: gentle high-pass preserves slow components; low-pass + line notch
   raw.filter(l_freq=0.1, h_freq=40.0, fir_design="firwin")   # FIR, linear phase
   raw.notch_filter(freqs=[50, 100, 150])                       # 50 Hz region + harmonics
   ```
   (Structured form: `mne_filter(name="raw", l_freq=0.1, h_freq=40, notch=50)`. For **ICA** use
   `l_freq=1.0`; for **TFR/low-freq power** keep the high-pass minimal/off.)

4. **Reference**, chosen for the downstream need:

   ```python
   raw.set_eeg_reference("average", projection=False)          # whole-head, common for source/ERP
   # linked mastoid:  raw.set_eeg_reference(["TP9", "TP10"])
   # REST (infinity): raw.set_eeg_reference("REST", forward=fwd) # needs an appropriate forward model
   ```
   (Structured form: `mne_set_reference(name="raw", ref_channels="average")` /
   `"TP9,TP10"`. REST requires `mne_run_code` with `forward=fwd`; the shortcut rejects REST.)

5. **Bad channels + interpolate** — prefer an objective criterion, then spline-interpolate:

   ```python
   # objective flag: flat or extreme-variance channels (illustrative thresholds)
   data = raw.get_data(picks="eeg"); v = data.var(axis=1)
   names = [raw.ch_names[i] for i in range(len(v))]
   flat = [names[i] for i in np.where(v < 1e-14)[0]]
   noisy = [names[i] for i in np.where(v > np.median(v) + 5 * np.std(v))[0]]
   raw.info["bads"] = sorted(set(flat + noisy))
   raw.interpolate_bads(reset_bads=True)                        # spline; needs montage
   ```
   (Structured form: `mne_mark_bad_channels(name="raw", bads="Fp1,T7")` then
   `mne_interpolate_bads(name="raw")`. **Record how many channels were interpolated — it lowers
   data rank** for any later ICA/source step.)

6. **Resample** — *after* epoching when you can; if on continuous data, keep events safe:
   `mne_resample(name="raw", sfreq=250)` (verify new sfreq > 2× the low-pass).

7. **Crop / annotate** bad segments: `mne_crop(name="raw", tmin=0, tmax=300)`, or mark
   `BAD_*` annotations so epoching drops them.

8. **Re-inspect.** `mne_plot_psd` again — confirm the line-noise spike is gone, the high-pass
   removed drift, and no channel still looks dead/noisy. Then **archive** the equivalent code +
   figures (the `mne-analyst` archiving convention).

Structured filter calls preflight finite cutoff/notch values against Nyquist, ordered band-pass
edges, and object notch support before processing. Zero high-pass is allowed by MNE; band-stop
designs use explicit code. Notch on Epochs/Evoked is rejected when the object has no notch method:
prefer continuous Raw before epoching. Crop bounds must lie within the current time range;
resampling requires a positive finite rate. These are parameter checks, not scientific approval.
Operations remain in place; unexpected runtime errors can still leave partial changes.

Best-practice reminders: filter **before** epoching to avoid edge artifacts at every epoch boundary;
pick the high-pass for the analysis; report **per-group** bad-channel/rejection counts; track how
many channels were interpolated (rank).

## PHASE 3 — CRITIC (before believing the result)

Hand the pipeline (filter band, reference, bad channels, resampling, order of operations) to
**`mne-methodology-critic`** (invoke the skill, or dispatch it as a subagent with
`references/methodology-checklist.md`). For preprocessing it will specifically check:

- **high-pass distortion** of slow ERP components (≳0.1–0.3 Hz can attenuate/shift CNV/P300);
- **filter applied before vs after epoching** (post-epoch filtering injects **edge artifacts** at
  every boundary);
- **reference choice biasing** later **connectivity / source** (average/common references inflate
  apparent connectivity and shift source estimates);
- **differential bad-channel handling** between groups (unequal interpolation fabricates group
  effects);
- **interpolation reducing data rank** (caps later ICA / source `n_components`);
- **resampling-induced event jitter** (downsampling continuous data before epoching shifts event
  timing).

Report its **BLOCK / REVISE / PASS** verdict to the user and act on it before stating that the data
are "clean."

See `references/preprocess-methods.md` for deeper recipes (FIR vs IIR & transition bandwidth, notch
strategies, reference math, objective bad-channel detection, rank bookkeeping, and pipeline order).
