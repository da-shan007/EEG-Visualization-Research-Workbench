# MNE Decoding / MVPA & BCI (grill → analyze → critic)

Multivariate decoding of neurophysiology data via the MNE MCP server. This skill is **skeptical by
design**: the most damaging decoding mistakes — **data leakage** and a **wrongly assumed chance
level** — produce a clean, plausible accuracy curve *without any error*, so the discipline is to
**grill the cross-validation before fitting and critique before believing.**

> Companion skills: `mne-mcp-guard` for technical execution safety; `mne-methodology-critic` for
> Phase 3. Loaded objects persist in one MNE session. Decoding needs **scikit-learn**.

## PHASE 1 — GRILL (before fitting anything)

Do **not** fit a classifier until these are answered. If the user can't answer one, propose a
sensible default **and explicitly flag the open risk** — never silently choose.

**What is being decoded**
- Which two (or more) conditions / labels, and what is the scientific *claim* tied to decodability?
- **Class balance and sizes** — n trials per class, per subject? (Imbalance silently inflates
  accuracy and breaks the nominal chance level.)
- Feature space: sensors × time? band power? source space? What is the classifier actually seeing?

**The two questions that decide validity**
- **Cross-validation structure.** Subject-level (**leave-one-subject-out**) or trial-level? If
  trial-level on pooled multi-subject data, do trials from one subject leak across train/test folds
  (⇒ identity decoding, inflated)? Is the split stratified by class? (This + leakage are the two
  fatal errors here.)
- **Is every transform fit INSIDE the fold?** Scaling, feature selection, ICA, PCA, even baseline
  z-scoring must be `fit` on **training data only** within each CV fold (use an sklearn `Pipeline`).
  Anything fit on the full dataset before CV = **leakage** ⇒ optimistic, invalid.

**Inference plan (pin this down NOW, not after seeing results)**
- **Chance level** — established by **label permutation** (shuffle labels, re-decode many times), not
  the nominal 1/n_classes. Imbalance and small n move true chance off 1/n.
- **Multiple comparisons across time** — a classifier per time point ⇒ many tests; plan a
  **cluster-based permutation** test of scores-vs-chance, not per-time-point thresholding.
- **Temporal-generalization claims.** Will off-diagonal generalization be read as
  *maintenance / reactivation* of a representation? That is a strong claim — state it in advance and
  guard it (it can also reflect a slow/sustained component, not reactivation).
- Metric: ROC-AUC / balanced accuracy (imbalance-robust) over raw accuracy?

## PHASE 2 — ANALYZE

1. **Capability + look first.** `mne_check_status` (confirm scikit-learn present); inspect class
   counts (`epochs["condA"]`, `epochs["condB"]`) — balance and totals decide metric and CV.
2. **Structured decoding (preferred path).** Read
   [structured-decoding.md](references/structured-decoding.md) for `mne_decode` parameters,
   grouped-CV examples, time windows, classifier options and output axes. Use named arguments:
   `mne_decode(cond_a="a", cond_b="b", scoring="roc_auc", cv=5)`.
   Read the PNG, per-fold scores and split diagnostics. A curve crossing 0.5 is descriptive,
   not a significance result. The tool supports binary labels only.
3. **Custom path (full control via `mne_run_code`).** Build a leakage-free `Pipeline` and slide it
   over time, cross-validated:

   ```python
   from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   from mne.decoding import SlidingEstimator, Scaler, Vectorizer, cross_val_multiscore
   X = epochs.get_data();  y = epochs.events[:, 2]          # transforms fit INSIDE folds
   clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000))
   sl  = SlidingEstimator(clf, scoring="roc_auc", n_jobs=-1)
   scores = cross_val_multiscore(sl, X, y, cv=5).mean(0)    # (n_times,)
   ```

4. **Temporal generalization.** Use `mne_decode(method="generalizing", ...)`; output axes are
   `(train_time, test_time)`, plotted with test time horizontal and train time vertical.
   Read the diagonal for same-time decoding. Off-diagonal scores show cross-time generalization,
   not proof of maintenance or reactivation. Crop with `tmin/tmax` to bound quadratic scoring cost;
   do not select the window after inspecting scores and then treat it as confirmatory.
5. **CSP for oscillatory BCI.** Band-pass first, then `mne.decoding.CSP` inside the pipeline:

   ```python
   from mne.decoding import CSP
   clf = make_pipeline(CSP(n_components=4), LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000))
   ```

6. **Establish an empirical null by permutation**: shuffle labels only within valid exchangeability
   blocks (for example within participant when the design permits), re-run the complete CV pipeline,
   build the null
   distribution of scores; compare the observed curve to it (`sklearn.model_selection.permutation_test_score`
   for a single window). For group inference, subjects, not overlapping CV folds, are independent
   observations. Predefine the multiple-comparison correction across time or the train/test matrix.
   For independent-subject mean curves/matrices, use `mne_decoding_group_test` after reading
   [group-inference.md](references/group-inference.md). It provides group sign flips with
   max-t or cluster correction, not within-subject label permutations or nested tuning.
7. **Archive** the equivalent code + figures (the `mne-analyst` archiving convention).

Best-practice reminders: ROC-AUC / balanced accuracy under imbalance; `Vectorizer` to flatten
features for plain sklearn estimators; report per-class n and the CV scheme explicitly.

## PHASE 3 — CRITIC (before believing the result)

Hand the design + result to **`mne-methodology-critic`** (invoke the skill, or dispatch it as a
subagent with `references/methodology-checklist.md`). For decoding work it will specifically check:

- **data leakage** — any transform fit on the full dataset before CV (*FAIL*);
- **nominal chance vs label-permutation** chance level;
- **class imbalance** — raw accuracy vs balanced accuracy / ROC-AUC, class sizes reported;
- **trial-level CV leaking** trials of one subject across folds (vs leave-one-subject-out);
- **temporal-generalization off-diagonal** over-interpretation (maintenance / reactivation);
- **multiple comparisons across time** — cluster-based permutation vs per-time-point thresholding.

Report its **BLOCK / REVISE / PASS** verdict to the user and act on it before stating conclusions.

See `references/decoding-methods.md` for deeper recipes (sliding vs generalizing estimators,
leakage-free pipelines, CSP, RSA, mTRF encoding, and permutation/cluster inference).
